# WAV to SND Converter Roadmap

## Overview
The WAV to SND converter will allow users to convert WAV files to the Akai S3000/MPC3000 SND format, making it compatible with the SND player and other Akai hardware/software.

## Phase 1: Basic WAV to SND Conversion
- [ ] Create WavToSndConverter component
- [ ] Implement WAV file parsing
  - [ ] Read WAV header (RIFF format)
  - [ ] Extract audio data (PCM)
  - [ ] Handle different sample rates (44.1kHz, 22.05kHz)
  - [ ] Support mono/stereo conversion to mono
- [ ] Implement SND header generation
  - [ ] Format byte (3 for S3000/MPC3000)
  - [ ] Sample rate flag (1 for 44.1kHz, 0 for 22.05kHz)
  - [ ] MIDI root note (default to C3=60)
  - [ ] Filename (12 bytes, AKAII format)
  - [ ] Loop settings (default to no loops)
  - [ ] Sample count and markers
- [ ] Add basic UI
  - [ ] File upload/drop zone
  - [ ] Conversion progress indicator
  - [ ] Download converted SND file

## Phase 2: Advanced Features
- [ ] Sample rate conversion
  - [ ] Resampling to 44.1kHz or 22.05kHz
  - [ ] Quality options (fast/high quality)
- [ ] Loop point support
  - [ ] Visual waveform display
  - [ ] Loop point markers
  - [ ] Loop mode selection (forward, reverse, ping-pong)
- [ ] Sample editing
  - [ ] Trim start/end
  - [ ] Normalize volume
  - [ ] Fade in/out
- [ ] Batch conversion
  - [ ] Multiple file upload
  - [ ] Progress tracking
  - [ ] Error handling

## Phase 3: Integration and Polish
- [ ] Integration with SND player
  - [ ] Direct playback after conversion
  - [ ] Preview before saving
- [ ] Error handling and validation
  - [ ] File format validation
  - [ ] Size limits
  - [ ] Error messages
- [ ] Performance optimization
  - [ ] Web Worker for processing
  - [ ] Progress streaming
  - [ ] Memory management
- [ ] UI/UX improvements
  - [ ] Dark/light theme
  - [ ] Responsive design
  - [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
  - [ ] Tooltips and help

## Phase 4: Additional Features
- [ ] Sample library management
  - [ ] Save converted samples
  - [ ] Organize by categories
  - [ ] Search and filter
- [ ] Export options
  - [ ] Different SND versions
  - [ ] WAV export
  - [ ] Batch export
- [ ] Sample analysis
  - [ ] Waveform visualization
  - [ ] Frequency analysis
  - [ ] Peak/RMS levels
- [ ] Presets
  - [ ] Save conversion settings
  - [ ] Share presets
  - [ ] Default presets

## Technical Considerations
1. File Format
   - WAV: RIFF format, PCM data
   - SND: 192-byte header, 16-bit PCM data
   - Endianness handling (little-endian for WAV, big-endian for SND)

2. Performance
   - Use Web Workers for processing
   - Stream large files
   - Optimize memory usage

3. Browser Compatibility
   - File API support
   - Web Worker support
   - AudioContext support

4. Testing
   - Unit tests for conversion
   - Integration tests with SND player
   - Browser compatibility tests
   - Performance benchmarks

## Future Enhancements
1. Hardware Integration
   - Direct transfer to Akai hardware
   - USB/MIDI support
   - Floppy disk image creation

2. Advanced Processing
   - Effects processing
   - Time stretching
   - Pitch shifting
   - Filtering

3. Community Features
   - Sample sharing
   - User presets
   - Sample packs
   - Community library

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 2: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 3: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 4: 2-3 weeks

Total estimated time: 6-10 weeks
